    <u><h1>Website</h1></u>
    <h1>
        Website is a collection of web pages, which are interlinked. The
        various web pages are prepared independently. And in the end they
        are linked in the required sequence depending on the logical
        makeup of information on the site. The link for a web page is
        basically a URL [Uniform Resource Locator]
        i.e the address of the computer where the web page is present.
        Such a collection of related web pages is called a website.

    <u><h1>Introduction to HTML</h1></u>
    <h1>
        In 1980, a mark up language was developed to create documents
        that could be displayed consistently on computers of different
        hardware and operating systems. It was called the Standard
        Generalized Markup Language or SGML on the web. HTML is
        used to construct formatted pages for the web known as web pages.

    <u><h1>Features of HTML</h1></u>
    <h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Each tag is enclosed within a &lt;(left bracket) and &gt;(right
                bracket). These special characters are what differentiate the
                tags from ordinary text.
            </li>
            <li>
                Opening is denoted by&lt;&gt;, for example &lt;I&gt;.This is the
                opening tag to display text in italics.
            </li>
            <li>
                Closing tag is denoted by &lt;/&gt;, for example &lt;/I&gt;. This is the
                closing italics tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tag names are not case sensitive but as a convention they are
                written in upper case so as to distinguish them from the
                normal text.
            </li>
        </ol>
